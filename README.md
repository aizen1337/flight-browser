## Description
My flight search engine is a web application built with the 12th version of Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. It allows users to search for flights based on their preferred dates, departure and arrival locations, number of passengers or flight class.

The search engine features a user-friendly interface that guides users through the search process. Upon landing on the homepage, users are presented with a search form where they can enter their travel details. The form includes fields for departure and arrival locations, travel dates, and the number of passengers.

Once the user submits their search, the application fetches flight data from my backend API and displays the results in a clear and concise manner. The search results page shows all available flights that match the user's search criteria, including the airline, departure and arrival times, and ticket prices.
